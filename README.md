## Assessing the Impact of Climate Change on Mortgage Repayment: Data from the US East Coast

This thesis investigates how climate-related events, specifically hurricanes and floods, affect mortgage repayment behavior along the US East Coast. Leveraging a dataset representing $11 trillion in mortgage exposure from Fannie Mae and integrating hurricane/cyclone data, the study quantifies climate-induced default risks faced by lenders.

Key highlights:
- Built and validated machine learning models in Python to predict mortgage defaults, achieving a 12% improvement in AUC and reducing false positive rates by 18%.
- Conducted rigorous backtesting and scenario analysis to evaluate model robustness under stressed market conditions.
- Proposed the adoption of IPCC-aligned capital buffers and enhanced default management strategies to address a projected 25% increase in climate-related risk exposure.

This research provides actionable insights for financial institutions seeking to strengthen their risk frameworks in the face of escalating climate threats.

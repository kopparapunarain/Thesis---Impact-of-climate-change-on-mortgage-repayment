This report explores the relation between climate change (here, hurricanes and floods) and mortgage repayment in the US East coast. 

Analyzed $11T worth of mortgages using hurricane/cyclone data to identify climate-induced default risk exposures.
• Developed machine learning models in Python to predict mortgage defaults, improving AUC by 12% and cutting
false positives by 18%.
• Performed backtesting and model validation to assess predictive accuracy under stressed market conditions.
• Proposed IPCC-aligned capital buffers and default management strategies to mitigate a 25% increase in
climate-related risk exposur
